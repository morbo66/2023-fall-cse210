This is a demo of my game. Run the program and you'll be given prompts to create
a character, You'll enter the maze and get to choose wether to fight a monster or 
solve a puzzle. The puzzles and monsters are both very basic. Once you reach a certain
score you will win the game. If your Hit Points reach 0 you will lose the game.
*hint* the word riddle is a famous Hellen Keller quote.
